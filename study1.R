# 'Only 35 participants scored below 6, 
# suggesting that most people were able to construct the images described the items.'
#
# Error in the paper! We forgot to subtract 1 from data values to map onto response scales
# so it should read 'below 5'
# 

# internal consistency of PSIQ
psych::alpha(PSIQ)
# 'The scale produced a Cronbachâ€™s alpha of .96, 
# with no improvement indicated by deleting any items.'

# Exploratory Factor Analysis
# using psych package functions, and requiring GPArotation for oblimin

# first drop mean and lo
PSIQ <- PSIQ %>% select(-mean, -lo)

# how many factors?
fa.parallel(PSIQ)
# should suggest seven factors
